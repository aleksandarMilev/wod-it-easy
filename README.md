# WodItEasy

## Overview
WodItEasy is a web application built using **React** for the frontend and **ASP.NET Core** for the backend. It follows **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** and **Clean Architecture** principles. The application is fully containerized using **Docker** and utilizes **MS SQL Server** as the database.

## Features
- **Identity Management**  
  Users can register and log in.
- **Workout Scheduling**  
  Administrators can create, update, and delete workouts, which users can access.
- **Participation in Workouts**  
  Athletes can join, cancel, and rejoin scheduled workouts.
- **Calories Tracking (Upcoming Feature)**  
  Users will be able to track their calorie intake and nutrition.
- **1RM Calculator & Daily Results Logging (Upcoming Feature)**  
  Users will be able to monitor their progress using a one-rep max calculator and logging daily workout results.

## Backend Architecture

### **Domain Layer**
- The Domain Layer contains the core business logic, rules, and validation. It remains independent of any external frameworks or dependencies, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

```
WodItEasy.Domain/
â”‚â”€â”€ Common/                  # Shared base classes and utilities used across the domain
â”‚â”€â”€ Exceptions/              # Custom domain-specific exceptions
â”‚â”€â”€ Factories/               # Factories for creating domain entities and aggregates
â”‚â”€â”€ Models/                  # Core domain entities and value objects
â”‚â”€â”€ DomainConfiguration.cs   # Extension method for registering domain services in the DI container 
```

### **Application Layer**
- Implements the application's use cases and business logic. It follows the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.

```
WodItEasy.Application/
â”‚â”€â”€ Behaviors/                    # MediatR pipeline behavior for validation
â”‚â”€â”€ Common/                       # Shared utilities and base classes
â”‚â”€â”€ Contracts/                    # Interfaces for repositories and some services
â”‚â”€â”€ Exceptions/                   # Custom application-specific exceptions
â”‚â”€â”€ Features/                     # Feature-specific command and query handlers (CQRS)
â”‚â”€â”€ Mapping/                      # AutoMapper additional logic
â”‚â”€â”€ ApplicationConfiguration.cs   # Extension method for registering application services in the DI container
â”‚â”€â”€ ApplicationSettings.cs        # The JWT secret string
â”‚â”€â”€ Result.cs                     # Utility class for encapsulating command (and in some cases query) results
```
